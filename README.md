# Abstract Interactive Art Music Mixer
![colourful-backgroud](images/background.jpg)
**My Concept:** Users land on the index page of the site, here they will find 6 abstract, differently coloured blobs in the centre of the page, as well as a library of various audio clips beneath them. Users will be prompted to drag and drag an audio clip of their choice onto a blob of their choice, an repeat this to create a unique beat. When the audio is dropped onto the blob, the shape will begin to animate in a unique way (spinning, growing and shrinking, etc.). Each blob will do its own unique animation when an audio clip is dropped on it. The idea is to create a abstract art piece using audio clips.

This is a GitHub Repository for MMED-1055 Multimedia Authoring 2 - Music Mixer

## MMED-1055 Mulitmedia Authoring 2 - Music Mixer - Assignment Brief
The focus of this project is to collaboratively research, experiment with and ultimately design and build a multimedia application using design and motion tools as well as HTML, CSS and JavaScript. Your team will implement drag and drop functionality to load audio clips and create a dynamic audio experience, trigger animation, and play a compiled audio track (see [www.incredibox.com](https://www.incredibox.com/) as a reference).

Try to implement this project in sprints - part of an agile workflow best practice. A sprint consists of a scoped mini-project that focuses on one particular deliverable or feature. The work you do lives on a specific branch; everything required to complete that deliverable is done on that branch and then merged to the main branch when finished.

Then it’s on to the next sprint!
